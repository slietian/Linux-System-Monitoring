# 🖥️ Linux System Monitoring Tool

A **Python-based system monitoring application** for tracking **CPU usage, memory consumption, disk utilization, network activity, and running processes** on Linux systems.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a **user-friendly command-line application** that allows users to monitor **system performance metrics** in real time.

It is built using **Python** and utilizes the **psutil** library to fetch system-level information.  
The tool helps in understanding how **operating systems manage system resources** such as CPU, memory, disk, and network.

## 📌 Features

✅ Monitors **CPU usage** (overall and per-core)  
✅ Tracks **memory and swap usage**  
✅ Displays **disk usage** information  
✅ Shows **network activity statistics**  
✅ Lists **running processes** with PID and resource usage  
✅ **Lightweight and fast** command-line tool

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Linux (Ubuntu)**
- **psutil**
- **Command Line / Terminal**

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Uses **psutil** to read system and process information from the OS  
- Collects real-time metrics for CPU, memory, disk, and processes  
- Displays the data in a clean and readable terminal format  
- Inspired by classic **UNIX/Linux tools** like **`top`**, **`ps`**, and **`free`**

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Hands-on experience with **Linux system internals**
- Understanding of **process management**
- Practical use of **Python for system utilities**
- Exposure to **system-level programming concepts**
