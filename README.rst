🔹 Summary

Linux System Monitoring Tool is a lightweight, cross-platform system utility built using Python.
It is designed to retrieve real-time information about running processes and system resource utilization such as:

CPU usage

Memory consumption

Disk usage

Network activity

This tool is primarily useful for system monitoring, process analysis, and understanding how operating systems manage system resources internally.

It is inspired by traditional UNIX/Linux command-line tools like top, ps, free, and netstat, providing similar insights through a Python-based implementation.

🖥️ Supported Platforms

The system monitoring tool works on the following operating systems:

Linux

Windows

macOS

FreeBSD / OpenBSD / NetBSD

Sun Solaris

AIX

🐍 Supported Python Versions

CPython 3.6 and above

PyPy

The project is developed and tested using modern Python environments.
